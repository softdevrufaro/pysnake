This is a small project that i did in pygame to make a simple version of the game snake. 
I made this for practice purposes and tried to comment the files to be as readable as can possibly be. 

The notes file helped me plan the process, though the documentation file i made using AI while do some experimentation. Most of what is in the documentation is likely covered in the notes.txt file 
as well as in the .py files for the application.

To all those who are interested in looking at this project you can use and change the code as you like improve it and make your own iterations as well. 
Good luck and have fun.
